# Computational-Neuroscience
This repository provides code, notes, exercises and solutions for popular Computational and Theoretical Neuroscience Algorithms and Formulas. These are meant to supplement the theoretical knowledge provided by

- [Computational Neuroscience](http://people.brandeis.edu/~pmiller/TEXTBOOK/index.html)
- [Theoretical Neuroscience](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~lmate/biblio/dayanabbott.pdf)

Each of the folders corresponds to a topic covered in the above textbooks. Each folder contains exercises and their broken down solutions, as well as key notes and references for further study.

The implementations are written in Python 3 and make use of a variety of mathematical and statistical libraries for readability and efficiency.
